# Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for programming tasks. The focus is on ensuring code quality, performance, and maintainability in C, C++, Java, Rust, and Python.

## Projects

*   Always write and maintain a README.md file describing how to install requirements and build and run the project.
*   Add temporary files used in the build of projects to the .gitignore file, so that they don't pollute the repo.

## General Principles

*   **Memory Safety:** Prioritize memory safety above all else. Use modern language features and tools to prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free, and data races.
*   **Performance:** Write efficient code, but not at the expense of clarity or safety. Profile and benchmark critical code paths to identify and optimize bottlenecks.
*   **Clarity and Maintainability:** Write clean, well-documented, and idiomatic code. This is crucial for long-term maintenance and collaboration.
*   **Resource Management:** Ensure that resources like file handles, memory, and network connections are properly acquired and released. Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) in C++ and Rust, and try-with-resources in Java.
*   **Error Handling:** Use robust error handling mechanisms. Avoid silent failures. Use exceptions in C++ and Java, `Result` and `Option` in Rust, and appropriate error-checking in C and Python.

## C

*   **Memory Management:**
    *   Always check the return value of `malloc`, `calloc`, and `realloc`.
    *   Use `free` to release memory exactly once. Avoid double-freeing and memory leaks.
    *   Use `valgrind` or similar tools to detect memory errors.
*   **Buffer Safety:**
    *   Use `strncpy`, `snprintf`, and other bounded string functions instead of their unbounded counterparts (`strcpy`, `sprintf`).
    *   Always check buffer sizes before writing to them.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** Be aware of and avoid undefined behavior (e.g., signed integer overflow, dereferencing null pointers).
*   **Tooling:**
    *   Compile with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` to catch potential issues at compile time.
    *   Use static analysis tools like `clang-tidy` and `cppcheck`.

## C++

*   **Modern C++:** Use modern C++ features (C++11/14/17/20).
    *   Use smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) for automatic memory management. Avoid raw `new` and `delete`.
    *   Use RAII to manage resources.
*   **The Standard Library:** Prefer standard library containers (`std::vector`, `std::string`, `std::array`) and algorithms over custom implementations.
*   **Concurrency:** Use `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, and `std::atomic` for multi-threading. Be mindful of data races and deadlocks.
*   **Performance:**
    *   Understand move semantics to avoid unnecessary copies.
    *   Use `const` and `constexpr` where appropriate.
*   Private class member variables have an underscore prefix (e.g.  _memberVariable ).
*   Method and function parameter names have an underscore suffix (e.g.  void function(int firstParameter_) ).

## C/C++ Formatting Style

Use the following these style rules for formatting C and C++ code:

*   Allman braces: opening brace on its own line for all blocks.
*   Indent with 2 spaces. Convert any tabs in code text to spaces (non-indent regions too).
*   Indent namespace bodies like normal blocks.
*   Preprocessor: indent multi-line #define wraps; indent #if/#endif at brace level 0 and when directly inside a namespace.
*   Spacing: add spaces around all operators; add a space between control keywords (if/for/while/switch) and (.
*   Pointers/refs bind to the type (int* p, T& x).
*   Indent column-1 // comments to the current block level.
*   Split one-line headers (if (x) do();) so the statement is on the next line; add braces to previously unbraced conditionals. Keep explicit one-line blocks on one line when present.
*   Templates: no space between nested > closers (>>).
*   Wrap lines at ~200 chars; when wrapping conditions, prefer breaking at logical operators. Allow up to ~120 spaces of continuation indent; minimum continuation indent in conditionals can be 0.
   
Apply these consistently across classes, functions, control flow, and preprocessor usage.

## Java

*   **Memory Management:**
    *   While the JVM handles garbage collection, be mindful of object lifetimes to avoid memory leaks (e.g., static collections that are never cleared).
*   **Concurrency:**
    *   Use the `java.util.concurrent` package for high-level concurrency utilities.
    *   Prefer immutable objects for thread safety.
    *   Use `synchronized` judiciously.
*   **Performance:**
    *   Be aware of the cost of object creation.
    *   Use the Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) for accurate performance testing.
    *   Understand the JIT compiler and how it optimizes code.
*   **NIO:** For high-performance I/O, use the New I/O (NIO) APIs.

## Rust

*   **Ownership and Borrowing:**
    *   Embrace the ownership model to ensure memory and thread safety at compile time.
    *   Use the borrow checker to your advantage. Prefer immutable borrows (`&`) over mutable borrows (`&mut`).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Use `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and `panic!` for unrecoverable errors.
    *   The `?` operator is your friend for propagating errors.
*   **Concurrency:**
    *   Rust's ownership model prevents data races. Use `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for shared, mutable state.
    *   Leverage crates like `rayon` for data parallelism and `tokio` or `async-std` for asynchronous programming.
*   **Unsafe Code:**
    *   Avoid `unsafe` blocks unless absolutely necessary and you can prove the code is sound.
    *   When `unsafe` is used, document thoroughly why it is necessary and why it is safe.

## Python

While Python is a high-level language, it's often used for systems-level scripting and interfacing with low-level code.

*   **Performance:**
    *   For CPU-bound tasks, use C extensions (e.g., with `ctypes` or `cffi`) or libraries like NumPy, which are implemented in C/Fortran.
    *   Use the `multiprocessing` module for parallelism. The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents true multi-threading for CPU-bound tasks.
*   **Resource Management:**
    *   Use the `with` statement for automatic cleanup of resources (e.g., files, locks).
*   **Interfacing with C/C++:**
    *   Use `ctypes` or `cffi` for calling functions in shared libraries.
    *   Be careful with data type conversions and memory management when crossing the language boundary.
*   **Type Hinting:** Use type hints (PEP 484) to improve code clarity and allow for static analysis with tools like `mypy`. This is especially important for complex systems.
